#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project📊

This project showcases comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using popular Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Multiple real-world datasets from Kaggle—including Austic Weather, Mall Customer Dataset, and Students Performance Dataset—are analyzed to uncover patterns, insights, and trends.

🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

Understand the structure and distribution of data

Identify patterns, correlations, and anomalies

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing

Visualize insights using statistical and graphical techniques

Build a strong foundation for further modeling or business decisions

📂 Datasets Used

The following Kaggle datasets are explored:
